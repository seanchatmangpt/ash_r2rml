# AshR2RML Documentation Hub (Diátaxis Framework)

AshR2RML maps ordinary Ash resources to a normalized semantic mapping IR (`AshR2RML.Mapping`) and standards-valid W3C R2RML Turtle while leaving relational persistence to the active Ash data layer (such as `AshPostgres`).

The documentation is organized using the **[Diátaxis documentation framework](https://diataxis.fr/)** into four distinct quadrants:

## Product Boundary Invariant

AshR2RML is **not** an `Ash.DataLayer`, graph database, triplestore, or SPARQL engine. Its job is deterministic semantic compilation:

```text
Ash.Resource + RDF metadata
          ↓
   AshR2RML.Mapping
      ╱       ╲
relational    R2RML
   state        │
 (AshPostgres) OBDA Engine
      ╲       ╱
     one subject
```
