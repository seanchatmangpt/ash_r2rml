# Side-by-side R2RML migration architecture

## Status

This document defines the first migration PR for the `ash_r2rml` fork. The fork remains an AshNeo4j repository at the base revision; the new R2RML work is intentionally additive until behavioral equivalence is demonstrated.

## System invariant

PostgreSQL does not need to become a graph database. A relational Ash resource may remain transactionally authoritative in PostgreSQL while exposing a virtual RDF graph through W3C R2RML mappings and a SPARQL-to-SQL OBDA engine.

The semantic and relational views must describe one admitted subject:

```text
Public ontologies / XAAS application profile / SHACL
                         |
                    Ash resource
                   /            \
       storage data layer      AshR2RML
       (control/authority)   (semantic compiler)
              |                   |
       SQL / Neo4j today     canonical mapping IR
                                  |
                         R2RML + SHACL artifacts
                                  |
                         future OBDA/SPARQL engine
```

The first PR does **not** authorize the lower-right path to mutate data and does **not** remove the control path.

## Why this is not search-and-replace

The fork contains valuable, already-tested extension machinery: Spark DSL sections, compile-time verifiers, persisted mappings, relationship introspection, deterministic query construction, and an extensive Neo4j test suite. Replacing those surfaces before the new semantic path is executable would discard evidence.

DfCM therefore keeps both topologies:

- **Control topology:** existing `AshNeo4j.DataLayer`, Bolt, Cypher, and its full tests.
- **Candidate topology:** `AshR2RML` Spark extension, canonical mapping IR, R2RML renderer, SHACL renderer, and validation receipt.

A resource can carry both the `neo4j` and `r2rml` DSL blocks. Presence of both mappings is observable through `AshR2RML.Resource.Info`.

## R2RML projection

The candidate path compiles Ash metadata into these R2RML concepts:

| Ash concept | R2RML concept |
| --- | --- |
| resource | `rr:TriplesMap` |
| table/view | `rr:logicalTable` + `rr:tableName` |
| SQL projection | `rr:logicalTable` + `rr:sqlQuery` |
| resource class | `rr:subjectMap` + `rr:class` |
| deterministic identity | `rr:template` |
| attribute | `rr:predicateObjectMap` + `rr:column` |
| typed attribute | `rr:objectMap` + `rr:datatype` |
| Ash relationship | referencing object map + `rr:parentTriplesMap` |
| source/destination attributes | `rr:joinCondition` child/parent columns |

Relationship destinations are dependency-closed. Rendering fails rather than silently dropping a relationship whose destination resource has not been semantically mapped.

## Admission rules

The Spark verifier rejects a mapping unless:

1. exactly one of `table_name` and `sql_query` is present;
2. class, graph, predicate, and datatype identifiers are absolute IRIs;
3. mapped attributes exist on the Ash resource;
4. mapped relationships exist and expose source/destination attributes;
5. an attribute is not mapped twice through the typed and untyped surfaces; and
6. the subject template includes every primary-key column placeholder.

These constraints make identity and joins explicit before Turtle generation.

## SHACL projection

SHACL is rendered from the same canonical mapping IR, not maintained independently. Required Ash attributes become `sh:minCount 1`; explicit R2RML datatypes become `sh:datatype`; mapped relationships become IRI-valued properties constrained to the destination RDF class.

The purpose is to preserve correspondence:

```text
Ash resource -> canonical mapping IR -> R2RML
                             |
                             +-------> SHACL
```

No hand-synchronized second schema is introduced.

## Validation receipt

`AshR2RML.validate/1` executes deterministic R2RML and SHACL rendering and records hashes. Successful rendering is intentionally reported as:

- status: `PARTIAL_ALIVE`
- standing: `semantic_projection_only`
- query parity: `UNKNOWN`
- blocked: `sparql_sql_behavioral_parity`, `cutover_authority`

This prevents a generated mapping file from being mistaken for an executed SPARQL system.

## Cutover falsifier

The candidate path is **not** ready to replace the control path if any of the following remains true:

- an Ash resource or relationship required by the admitted application profile has no R2RML mapping;
- R2RML or SHACL generation is nondeterministic;
- an OBDA engine cannot execute the generated mappings against the target PostgreSQL schema;
- paired SQL and SPARQL queries over the same fixture produce different normalized result multisets;
- transaction/identity semantics differ across the compared subject boundary; or
- production cutover authority has not been explicitly granted.

## Next validation phase

The next phase should add an actual PostgreSQL fixture plus an OBDA engine (for example Ontop) and define a corpus of paired queries. Each case should carry:

```text
subject identity
PostgreSQL schema + fixture hash
R2RML mapping hash
SPARQL query
reference SQL query
normalized SQL result hash
normalized SPARQL result hash
parity verdict
```

Only successful execution of that corpus can move `query_parity` from `UNKNOWN` to `VERIFIED`. Only then should a separate cutover PR be considered.
