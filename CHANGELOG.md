## [v26.8.25](https://github.com/seanchatmangpt/ash_r2rml/releases/tag/v26.8.25) (2026-08-25)

### Features & Architectural Highlights:
* **`Ash.DataLayer.Ets` as a First-Class Backend**: `AshR2RML.DataLayer.backend/1` and a `storage_backend: :postgres | :ets` compiler option make `Ash.DataLayer.Ets` a fully supported compilation and query-execution target alongside `AshPostgres`.
* **`AshR2RML.OBDA.InMemory`**: the ETS-side OBDA counterpart to Ontop — materializes real `Ash.DataLayer.Ets` rows into a real `RDF.Graph` via the canonical mapping IR and executes full SPARQL (`SELECT`/`ASK`/`CONSTRUCT`/`DESCRIBE`, single- and composite-key cross-resource joins) in-process through `AshR2RML.SPARQL.Local`.
* **Field-Policy Security Hardening**: real Ash field-policy enforcement across both OBDA surfaces — enforced directly by `AshR2RML.OBDA.InMemory`'s use of `Ash.read!/2`, and structurally closed for the Ontop/Postgres surface by the new `AshR2RML.Security.sanitize_mapping/2`, which strips any field-policy-protected R2RML-mapped attribute from an `AshPostgres`-backed mapping before it can be rendered. Confirmed against a live Postgres 15.2 + Ontop 5.5.0 stack.
* **RDF/Turtle Injection Hardening**: subject/object IRIs built from row data in `AshR2RML.OBDA.InMemory` are now validated or percent-encoded before touching the graph, matching Ontop's own confirmed `rr:template` behavior.
* **Real Benchmark Suite**: `bench/compilation_and_rendering.exs` and `bench/obda_query_latency.exs` measure real compilation and OBDA query-latency numbers against AshR2RML's own supported stack only (Ash, `Ash.DataLayer.Ets`, `AshPostgres`, Ontop) — recorded in `bench/RESULTS.md`.

### Bug Fixes:
* fixed a struct-update typing violation in `AshR2RML.Telemetry.OCEL2.reconstruct_from_events/1` that failed a forced `mix compile --warnings-as-errors`.
* made custom `AshR2RML.Type` lexical decoders lawfully overridable.

## [v26.8.22](https://github.com/seanchatmangpt/ash_r2rml/releases/tag/v26.8.22) (2026-08-22)

### Features & Architectural Highlights:
* **W3C R2RML Compilation Engine**: Full standards-valid compilation of Ash resources into W3C R2RML Turtle mappings (`AshR2RML.Compiler`, `AshR2RML.Mapping`).
* **Ontop 5.5 OBDA Integration**: Virtual SPARQL-to-SQL execution against live PostgreSQL with 100% semantic identity preservation.
* **DfCM Semantic Types & Ontology Generator**: Ontology-first semantic type compiler and provider ecosystem (`AshR2RML.SemanticTypes`).
* **Ash.Reactor Saga Integration**: Complete Zach Daniel-style step modules, middleware telemetry, and compensation rollback pipelines (`AshR2RML.Reactor`).
* **IEEE OCEL 2.0 Telemetry Stream**: Signed event envelopes and live fly client transport (`AshR2RML.Telemetry.FlyClient`).
* **Exhaustive Verification**: 320+ automated tests across Fortune 5 profiles, adversarial refusal codes, and clean-room deterministic replay.




### Bug Fixes:

* atomic upsert writes all_labels, not label_pair (#392) by Matt Beanland

## [v0.10.0](https://github.com/diffo-dev/ash_neo4j/compare/v0.9.0...v0.10.0) (2026-06-21)

This release opened on functionality and pivoted to industrialisation and integrity: the write path is now atomic and constraint-backed, the read path gains a graph-native traversal expression, and the whole data layer returns typed errors rather than raising. The headline is **graph traversal as a first-class Ash expression** — a multi-hop path that pushes down to Cypher and composes with the rest of your filter, which a relational data layer structurally cannot offer.

### Breaking Changes

* **`AshNeo4j.Types.*` → `AshNeo4j.Type.*`** (#323) — the type namespace is renamed to singular, matching `Ash.Type`. Update `AshNeo4j.Types.Vector` → `AshNeo4j.Type.Vector` (and any other `AshNeo4j.Types.*` reference) in your attribute declarations. No storage or behaviour change.

### Features

* **Graph traversal as an Ash expression** (#321) — `traverse(^hop_chain, projection)` expresses a multi-hop, direction-and-type-selected path *inside* an `Ash.Expr`, and the data layer pushes it down to a Cypher path pattern instead of an imperative load-time Elixir walk. `hop_chain` is a list of `{:forward | :reverse, edge_selector}` hops; `edge_selector` is an Ash relationship name or an explicit `{:edge, label}` / `{:edge, label, dest}`. The reached node composes as a value in a `filter`:
  - reached-node field comparison — `filter(traverse(^chain, :status) == "active")`
  - spatial composition (#330, #332) — `filter(st_dwithin(traverse(^chain, :location), ^point, 5_000))` ("services whose site is within 5 km of a point") in one query
  - membership / cardinality (#334) — `traverse(^chain, :exists) == true`, `traverse(^chain, :count) > 0`
  - field aggregates (#338) — `traverse(^chain, {:min | :max | :avg | :sum, :field}) <op> value`
  - reverse-terminal node typing (#336)

  This is radical for Ash: relational data layers model relationships as joins and have no notion of a path as an expression value — so this isn't parity work, it's a graph-native differentiator. The filter context ships now; `sort` (#335), `calculate`/policy, and variable-length are tracked on the open epic #321. See `usage-rules/traverse.md`.

* **Read-time polymorphic projection — `AshNeo4j.Calculations.ProjectedTraversal` + `AshNeo4j.Unknown`** (#329) — a calculation that follows a hop chain and returns the reached node, late-binding its concrete type at read time. Introduces `AshNeo4j.Unknown`, a first-class value complementary to `Ash.NotLoaded`: `NotLoaded` means "not fetched yet"; `Unknown` means "reached, but couldn't be determined in the current view of the graph". Never collapse it into `nil`.

* **Atomic & bulk writes** (#361) — atomic updates render `changeset.atomics` straight to a Cypher `SET` (numeric, string `concat`/`trim`, and enum/atom forms); bulk update and destroy run as a single `update_query/4` / `destroy_query/4` via `Ash.bulk_update` / `Ash.bulk_destroy` with `strategy: :atomic`; a single filtered (optimistic-lock) update or destroy whose guard no longer holds returns `Ash.Error.Changes.StaleRecord` rather than a silent no-op.

* **Atomic upsert** (#379) — create-or-update keyed on an identity renders an atomic Cypher `MERGE`, so concurrent upserts converge on one node instead of racing to duplicates.

* **Identities & primary keys as Neo4j uniqueness constraints** (#20, #32) — `AshNeo4j.Constraint.create_constraints/1` builds `CREATE CONSTRAINT … IS UNIQUE` for every enforceable identity and for the primary key (single and composite, Community Edition). A conflict surfaces as Ash's own `Ash.Error.Changes.InvalidAttribute` ("has already been taken"), so `pre_check?` and its race window are no longer needed. Identities Neo4j can't enforce (`nils_distinct?: false`, filtered `where:`) are refused rather than silently unenforced. Like indexes, AshNeo4j runs no migrations on boot — you invoke the helper. See `usage-rules/identities.md`.

* **Typed tensor attribute — `AshNeo4j.Type.NxTensor`** (#309) — a shape-and-element-typed tensor backed by `Nx.Tensor`, rank 1 to 3 (vector / matrix / 3-tensor), stored row-major as a native property `LIST` (`:property`, default) or a base64 binary blob (`:packed`); neither type nor shape is stored — both are declared constraints recovered on read. Foundation slice of the hybrid tensor/compute epic (#308); structural ops are `Nx`'s own (the value is an `Nx.Tensor`).

* **Dynamic node labels** (#339) — a capability + pattern-position render primitive letting a label be supplied at query time (Cypher 5 ≥ 5.26), groundwork for polymorphic-label reads.

* **Cypher fragment filter escape hatch** (#33) — `cypher_fragment(...)` drops a raw, parameterised Cypher predicate into a `filter` for the rare case the expression surface can't reach, without abandoning the data layer. A caveated last resort, not a default. See `usage-rules/cypher-fragments.md`.

* **Query results as Mermaid flowcharts** (#60) — `AshNeo4j.Mermaid` renders a graph-level query result as a Mermaid diagram for docs and Livebooks.

* **APOC availability healthcheck** (#386) — detects whether APOC procedures are installed on the connected server, so APOC-dependent paths can degrade explicitly.

* **Nested arrays** (#317) — `{:array, {:array, _}}` round-trips via an outer native `LIST` with inner JSON.

### Improvements

* **The data layer returns typed errors, never raises** (#342, #350, #358, #372) — every read/write-path failure is a returned `{:error, Splode}` with a class, not a raised string. New errors: `UnresolvableTraversal` (a traverse filter that can't be formed — never a fabricated edge), `GeoDimensionMismatch`, `Unsupported3DGeometry`, `RequiresCypher25`. Neo4j server errors are surfaced and classified rather than flattened. Bare-string errors throughout the data layer are now typed (#372).

* **Many-to-many modelled as back-to-back `has_many` fails fast** (#127) — with a clear error pointing at a joiner resource node, instead of silently mis-relating.

* **Guarded relationship attach/detach honours `changeset.filter`** (#368) — a `StaleRecord` on miss, consistent with the guarded update/destroy path.

* **Type-check gate** (#347) — CI compiles `--warnings-as-errors` and runs Dialyzer on a clean baseline; the test suite compiles warning-free.

* **Logging unified** (#373, #374) — one data-layer log format; "nothing deleted" demoted from error to debug.

* **CYPHER 5 sunset tripwire** (#363) and **`bolty` 0.2.0** (#362); toolchain bumped to Elixir 1.20 / OTP 29 and Neo4j 5 to 5.26.27 (#318, #320).

## [v0.9.0](https://github.com/diffo-dev/ash_neo4j/compare/v0.8.1...v0.9.0) (2026-06-09)

### Breaking Changes

* **Minimum Neo4j / Bolt raised** (#292, #293) — bumps to [`bolty`](https://hex.pm/packages/bolty) 0.1.0, which speaks Bolt 5.6–6.0, so Neo4j 4.x (Bolt 4.x) is no longer supported. Flagged as breaking for completeness, but it should break no one in practice: Neo4j 4.x is end-of-life and not considered secure, so no realistic ash_neo4j deployment targets it.

### Features

* **Vector embeddings & similarity search** (#74) — a new `AshNeo4j.Types.Vector` attribute type, stored as a Neo4j `LIST<FLOAT>`, with `vector_similarity` (cosine) and `vector_cosine_distance` Ash query functions, k-NN ordering pushed down to Cypher, and `AshNeo4j.Vector` index-lifecycle helpers. Vector predicates and ordering route to a Cypher-25-capable pool. Because the values persist as `LIST<FLOAT>` (the native `VECTOR` type can't be a node property), the feature is gated on Cypher 25.

* **WGS-84-3D points** (#270, Phase 1) — `%Geo.PointZ{}` (srid 4979) stores as a native 3D Neo4j `POINT` at `<attr>.point`, with `point.distance` pushdown in 3D and an in-memory haversine (mean-height-scaled arc + Δh) that matches Neo4j to ~0.1 m. A strict dimension policy stops 2D and 3D mixing silently — a mismatch raises `AshNeo4j.Error.GeoDimensionMismatch`, and `AshNeo4j.Geo.force_2d/1` does an explicit downward projection. 3D areal/linear geometry (`PolygonZ`, …) raises `AshNeo4j.Error.Unsupported3DGeometry`, deferred to Phase 2.

* **CYPHER 25 language selector** (#292, #293) — on Neo4j ≥ 2025.06, AshNeo4j auto-prepends `CYPHER 25` to generated queries, opting into the versioned Cypher 25 language; older servers stay on Cypher 5. The selector is derived from the server version and cached per pool, and is distinct from the Bolt protocol version.

### Bug Fixes

* **Spatial POINT index now effective at scale** (#311) — two issues left geospatial queries unindexed despite a POINT index existing. A `:point_z` attribute built indexes on the `.bbSW`/`.bbNE` companions a `%Geo.PointZ{}` never writes (it now indexes the `.point` it stores), and the `within_bbox` / `within_bbox_box` containment form put the indexed properties in the box position, forcing a `NodeByLabelScan`. The containment predicates are reformulated into range scans on the indexed corners (`NodeIndexSeekByRange`). Benchmarked at N=10k: indexed `st_dwithin` ~6–7×; point-in-polygon containment is index-servable but caps near ~1.3× (single-corner seek).

* **`exists` over an empty result is `false`, not `nil`** (#301).

* **CYPHER 25 selector emitted once** (#299) — inside a `CALL {…}` combination block the selector was prepended per branch and again on the outer query; it is now emitted only once, on the outer query.

* **Root-node aggregates** (#291) — an aggregate with no relationship path now aggregates over the root node, not an unbound relationship variable.

* **Domain-fragment label resolution** (#295) — uses `Code.ensure_compiled/1` so a domain-fragment label resolves under any compilation order.

* **Test-suite stability** (#304) — caps ExUnit `max_cases` to the Bolt pool size, removing intermittent `DBConnection` `:queue_timeout` failures under parallel tests (test-only; no runtime effect).

## [v0.8.1](https://github.com/diffo-dev/ash_neo4j/compare/v0.8.0...v0.8.1) (2026-05-31)




### Bug Fixes:

* drop stale geo companions when a geo value changes shape (#287) by Matt Beanland

* scope node-read pagination to nodes, not edge rows (#285) by Matt Beanland

* clear geo companions when a geo attribute is cleared to nil (#283) by Matt Beanland

## [v0.8.0](https://github.com/diffo-dev/ash_neo4j/compare/v0.7.0...v0.8.0) (2026-05-28)

### Breaking Changes

* **Spatial storage rearchitecture** (#274) — the spatial surface introduced in 0.7.0 is replaced. The `AshNeo4j.Type.Point` and `AshNeo4j.Type.Box` modules are **removed**; spatial attributes now use [`ash_geo`](https://hex.pm/packages/ash_geo) types and carry [`%Geo.*{}`](https://hex.pm/packages/geo) structs. `Bolty.Types.Point` no longer appears at the Ash boundary (it was a driver-layer type leaking through). Migration:
  - `attribute :loc, AshNeo4j.Type.Point` → `attribute :loc, AshGeo.GeoJson, constraints: [geo_types: [:point], force_srid: 4326]`
  - `attribute :b, AshNeo4j.Type.Box` → `attribute :b, AshGeo.GeoJson, constraints: [geo_types: [:polygon], force_srid: 4326]` (Box was always proto-Polygon; axis-aligned validation is now an application-layer concern)
  - values: `Bolty.Types.Point.create(:wgs_84, lng, lat)` → `%Geo.Point{coordinates: {lng, lat}, srid: 4326}`; `%AshNeo4j.Type.Box{sw, ne}` → `%Geo.Polygon{coordinates: [ring], srid: 4326}`
  - **on-disk shape changed**: Point's native Point moves from `<attr>` to `<attr>.point` and gains a `<attr>.json` canonical; Box's 4-Point array becomes `<attr>.json` + `<attr>.bbSW`/`<attr>.bbNE`. Existing 0.7.0 spatial nodes need re-creation or a one-shot migration cypher (AshNeo4j ships no migrations by design).

  Adds `ash_geo ~> 0.3` as a runtime dependency (clean — `jason`/`geo`/`ash`; the PostGIS-flavoured deps are test-only in ash_geo).

### Features

* **Full GeoJSON geometry surface** (#274) — `AshGeo.GeoJson` / `AshGeo.GeoAny` attributes support all RFC 7946 geometry types: `Point`, `LineString`, `Polygon`, `MultiPoint`, `MultiLineString`, `MultiPolygon`. The data layer detects geometry values (classification `:geo` in `TypeClassifier`) and stores them as a canonical RFC 7946 GeoJSON `STRING` at `<attr>.json` plus indexable scalar Point companions — native `<attr>.point` for Point (preserving `point.distance`/`point.withinBBox` pushdown), `<attr>.bbSW`/`<attr>.bbNE` bounding-box corners for everything else. On-disk GeoJSON is strict RFC 7946 (no `crs` member, `bbox` member included) so any GIS tool can ingest it directly.

* **Recursive geo-promotion** (#274) — a geometry nested inside another attribute (an `Ash.TypedStruct` field, embedded resource, map) has its indexable companion promoted to a node-level property at the dotted path (`<attr>.<field>.point` etc.), even though the parent value stores as a single JSON blob. A location buried inside a characteristic is indexable via `point.distance(n.`characteristic.location.point`, …)`. The data layer walks the value tree on write (`geo_walk/2`) and round-trips the nested geometry on read.

* **`st_closest_point`** (#274) — new `Ash.Query.Function` returning the nearest vertex (`%Geo.Point{}`) from a `LineString` or `MultiPoint` to a target point. In-memory.

* **`AshNeo4j.Spatial` index helpers** (#275) — `create_index/3` / `drop_index/2` build and run the POINT index Cypher backing spatial pushdown from a resource module + attribute name, resolving the Neo4j label, the attribute→property translation, and the companion suffix convention (`.point` for a Point; both `.bbSW`/`.bbNE` for any other geometry, in one call). Nested geometries take a `[attribute, field…]` path (`create_index(Place, [:pet, :home])`) and resolve the dotted property by walking the `Ash.TypedStruct` fields. `create_index/3` is idempotent (`CREATE … IF NOT EXISTS`), takes `recreate: true` (DROP + CREATE) for storage-shape changes, and `name:` to override the derived index name. `index_statements/3` returns the exact Cypher without touching the database, for review or a dry run. Consistent with the "no migrations, index lifecycle is the operator's concern" stance (#45) — an ergonomic tool you call, not automatic behaviour.

* **`AshNeo4j.worlds/1` — N-world projection** (#273, **exploratory**) — a Neo4j node carries labels for *every* `(Domain, Resource)` world it participates in, but an Ash read returns only the queried world's struct. `worlds/1` projects a read record's labels (already on `__metadata__.labels`) back to the loadable resource modules — `[{domain, resource}, …]` ordered **outermost-first** — so a consumer can recover the outer type(s) of a polymorphic node for cross-domain late binding ([diffo#172](https://github.com/diffo-dev/diffo/issues/172)) without dropping to Cypher. An outer world contains the inner worlds and adds detail, so it carries more labels (more labels = more nuanced = more outer). Resolution is dynamic against loaded modules (no registry): a candidate is a loaded `AshNeo4j.DataLayer` resource whose own labels are a subset of the node's, the outermost (most-nuanced) is kept per domain, and the loaded-resource index is cached in `:persistent_term`. Labels that don't resolve to a loaded module are left unknown — omitted, never coerced. Returns `[]` for a non-AshNeo4j record. Pre-1.0 and may change — shipped to learn its shape from real downstream use.

### Improvements

* **In-memory distance matches Neo4j's `point.distance`** (#274) — `st_distance` / `st_dwithin` push down to Neo4j's native `point.distance` inside comparison filters but evaluate in Elixir elsewhere (`order_by`, `calculate`, LineString/MultiPoint). Both now use the same model — a spherical haversine on the WGS-84 **equatorial** radius (6 378 137 m), the radius Neo4j uses, not the mean Earth radius (6 371 000 m) — so the two paths agree to within ~1 m over 700 km rather than diverging by ~0.11 % (≈800 m). Single source of truth `AshNeo4j.Geo.haversine_meters/2`, shared by `st_distance` and `st_closest_point`; a sandbox test asserts the paths stay in step.

* **`st_*` expression functions extended** (#274) — `st_distance` / `st_dwithin` / `st_intersects` / `st_contains` / `st_within` now operate on `%Geo.*{}` argument shapes across the full geometry surface. Pushdown gating reads the attribute's `geo_types` constraint rather than the (now-removed) type-module identity.

* **Exact, hole-aware polygon predicates** (#267) — `st_contains` and `st_intersects` refine via [`topo`](https://hex.pm/packages/topo) on the actual `%Geo.*{}` rings, replacing the bbox approximation. A point in the bounding box but outside the ring is correctly excluded; a point in an interior ring (hole) is not contained; a LineString that crosses a Polygon **without** a vertex inside it correctly intersects. Inside `Ash.Query.filter`, `st_contains` keeps the indexed `point.withinBBox` bbox **prefilter** in Cypher and runs the exact `topo` test in-memory over the candidates (a true match always lies within the bbox, so the prefilter never drops one). Adds `topo ~> 1.0` runtime dep.

* **Exact geometry-to-Point distance** (#279) — `st_distance` (and `st_dwithin`, which delegates to it) now measures **any geometry to a Point** exactly: LineString/MultiLineString use the true closest-point-on-**segment** instead of closest-vertex (the old approximation could overstate a mid-edge proximity by tens of kilometres — e.g. 78.7 km reported where the perpendicular distance is 55.7 km), and Polygon/MultiPolygon return `0` when the point is inside (hole-aware via `topo`) or the nearest-boundary distance otherwise. `st_closest_point` likewise returns the closest point on the nearest segment of a LineString (an interior edge point, not just a vertex). New `AshNeo4j.Geo.point_segment_meters/3` / `closest_point_on_segment/3` / `min_segment_meters/2` primitives (local equirectangular projection to find the closest point, haversine for the distance). Distance between two non-Point geometries is still deferred. Also confirms MultiLineString — the sixth RFC 7946 geometry — round-trips through storage and works across the predicates, and extends `st_contains` to accept LineString / MultiLineString containees.

* **`AshNeo4j.GeoJson`** (#274) — RFC 7946 encoder/decoder wrapping `geo`; strips the obsolete `crs` member (which `geo` emits when `srid` is set — see [felt/geo#250](https://github.com/felt/geo/issues/250)), injects the `bbox` member, key-sorts via `AshNeo4j.Util.json_encode`. `Util.to_json_safe`/`json_decode` gained symmetric Geo handling so geometries survive nesting inside JSON-stored types. Local workarounds for [ash_geo#13](https://github.com/bcksl/ash_geo/pull/13) (bare-atom `geo_types` formatter crash) and [ash_geo#14](https://github.com/bcksl/ash_geo/pull/14) (`cast_stored` map handling) are in place pending those upstream fixes.

## [v0.7.0](https://github.com/diffo-dev/ash_neo4j/compare/v0.6.0...v0.7.0) (2026-05-25)

### Features

* **Spatial types and `st_*` expressions** (#45) — first-class WGS-84 2D spatial support. New attribute types `AshNeo4j.Type.Point` (native Neo4j Point) and `AshNeo4j.Type.Box` (axis-aligned bounding box, 4-vertex straight-sided polygon on disk). Six `Ash.Query.Function` modules matching ash_geo / PostGIS signatures: `st_contains` (box-point, box-box), `st_within`, `st_intersects`, `st_distance` (point-point, with comparison pushdown), `st_distance_in_meters` (alias), `st_dwithin` (point-point). Predicates push down to native Cypher (`point.distance`, `point.withinBBox`) wherever possible; in-memory `evaluate/1` is the correctness fallback. Box's on-disk storage uses a 4-Point vertex array plus 4 scalar bbox-corner companion properties (`<prop>.bbSW/.bbSE/.bbNE/.bbNW`) written by a generic `companions/1` callback on the Type module — the same shape future Polygon support ([#267](https://github.com/diffo-dev/ash_neo4j/issues/267)) will use, so no data migration when Polygon lands. The bbox companions are scalar Point properties specifically to be indexable via Neo4j's POINT index — storage is **indexable, not yet indexed** (operators run `CREATE POINT INDEX` themselves; lifecycle management is future work). Documentation in `usage-rules/spatial.md`. Requires `bolty >= 0.0.13` for native Point property serialisation ([bolty#32](https://github.com/diffo-dev/bolty/issues/32)).

* **Combination queries** (#10) — support for all five `Ash.Query.Combination` types (`:base`, `:union`, `:union_all`, `:intersect`, `:except`). Combinations of only `:union` or only `:union_all` push down to a single Cypher `CALL { … UNION/UNION ALL … } WITH s OPTIONAL MATCH (s)-[r]-(d) RETURN s, r, d` block, with per-branch parameter prefixing to avoid name collisions. Combinations involving `:intersect`, `:except`, or mixed union types take an in-memory orchestration path — each branch runs returning just node ids (`id(s) AS sid`), the set operation is computed in Elixir over `MapSet`s, then a final `MATCH WHERE id(s) IN $ids` fetches the keep-set with the standard OPTIONAL MATCH enrichment. Cypher has no native `INTERSECT`/`EXCEPT`; the in-memory implementation is the honest answer. Documentation in `usage-rules/combination-queries.md`. New `AshNeo4j.Cypher.Query` builders: `branch_node_read/3`, `branch_node_read_ids/3`, `combination_block/2`, `node_read_by_ids/2`; new `param_prefix:` opt on `node_read_filtered/3` and `build_conditions/3`. New `AshNeo4j.Cypher.Call` clause type.

## [v0.6.0](https://github.com/diffo-dev/ash_neo4j/compare/v0.5.1...v0.6.0) (2026-05-19)

### Breaking Changes

* **Introspection API renamed** (#105) — `AshNeo4j.DataLayer.Info` and `AshNeo4j.DataLayer.Domain.Info` are now generated by `Spark.InfoGenerator`. AshNeo4j now declares a direct `spark >= 2.7.0` dependency to guarantee availability. All functions follow the InfoGenerator convention: `neo4j_label/1` returns `{:ok, value} | :error`; `neo4j_label!/1` returns the value or raises; list options (`relate`, `guard`, `skip`) always return the list via the `!` variant. Previous hand-rolled helpers (`label/1`, `relate/1`, `guard/1`, `skip/1`) are removed.

### Features

* **Domain fragment label** (#261) — domains can declare a cross-domain graph label via `AshNeo4j.DataLayer.Domain` (`use Ash.Domain, extensions: [AshNeo4j.DataLayer.Domain]` with `neo4j do label :MyLabel end`). The fragment label is written as an additional Neo4j node label on CREATE, enabling polymorphic graph traversals across domains. Exposed via `ResourceInfo.domain_fragment_label/1` and included in `ResourceInfo.all_labels/1` and `ResourceInfo.mapping/1`.

### Bug Fixes

* **`belongs_to` source attribute always nil after read** (#258) — `belongs_to` source attributes (e.g. `specification_id`) were correctly populated on create but lost on any subsequent read. The enrichment step now correctly extracts the relationship attribute from the destination node returned by the OPTIONAL MATCH traversal when the source resource uses a fragment-inherited relationship whose destination lives in a different domain.

* **Domain fragment label dropped on Ash 3.25+** — `ResourceInfo.all_labels/1` was returning the compile-time persisted label list, which is baked before the domain extension compiles under Ash 3.25's updated compilation order, causing the domain fragment label to be silently omitted. `all_labels/1` now always computes dynamically from the individual label accessors, consistent with how `mapping/1` already worked.

### Improvements

* **Scalar filter pushdown for aggregates** (#253) — filtered aggregates whose filter consists entirely of scalar `==` equality predicates on non-embedded destination attributes now push a `WHERE d.prop = $val` clause directly into Cypher, avoiding full destination record loading in Elixir. Complex filters (OR, embedded fields, non-equality operators) continue to use the Elixir-side path introduced in #252.

## [v0.5.1](https://github.com/diffo-dev/ash_neo4j/compare/v0.5.0...v0.5.1) (2026-05-10)

### Improvements

* **Documentation** (#249) — ex_doc configuration overhauled: extras reorganised with titled entries, module groups defined for AshNeo4j, Introspection, Cypher, Utilities and Internals, Livebook added to How To, CHANGELOG included in About AshNeo4j, maintainer contact updated.

### Bug Fixes

* **Aggregate filters honoured** (#252) — filters declared via `filter expr(...)` on aggregate definitions were silently dropped. Filtered aggregates now load full destination records in Elixir and apply `Ash.Filter.Runtime.filter_matches/3` per source group before reducing. The fast Cypher push-down path is preserved for unfiltered aggregates.

* **Aggregate names with `?` suffix** (#251) — aggregate names following the Elixir predicate convention (e.g. `exists :cvc_defined?, :characteristics`) caused Neo4j to reject the generated Cypher with an invalid identifier error. Column aliases are now backtick-quoted, allowing any valid Elixir atom as an aggregate name.

## [v0.5.0](https://github.com/diffo-dev/ash_neo4j/compare/v0.4.1...v0.5.0) (2026-05-08)

### Features

* **Aggregates** — full support for `:count`, `:exists`, `:sum`, `:avg`, `:min`, `:max`, `:first`, `:list` aggregate kinds, declared in the standard Ash `aggregates` block. Aggregates are executed as Cypher `OPTIONAL MATCH` traversals; single-hop and multi-hop relationship paths are both supported.
* **Aggregates on embedded/JSON-type fields** — when `field:` points to an attribute stored as JSON (`Ash.TypedStruct`, `Ash.Type.NewType`, embedded resources, `Ash.Type.Map`, etc.) AshNeo4j collects raw JSON from Neo4j and deserializes in Elixir. `:list` and `:first` return fully-typed structs; `:sum`/`:avg`/`:min`/`:max` work on directly comparable values.
* **Expression aggregates (`expr:`)** — programmatic aggregate API (`Ash.aggregate/3`) accepts `expr:` to aggregate over a sub-field of an embedded struct or any Ash expression, without needing to elevate the field. Fetches full destination records and evaluates expressions in Elixir.
* **Expression calculations** — `calculate :name, :type, expr(...)` declarations are now evaluated in Elixir after records are loaded. Supports load (`Ash.load!`), filter (`Ash.Query.filter`), and sort (`Ash.Query.sort`). Embedded struct fields work directly via `get_path` — no elevation needed.

### Improvements

* Cypher query struct family extended; `Neo4jHelper` refactored to use it
* Calculation-based filter predicates are excluded from Cypher WHERE and evaluated in-memory via `Ash.Filter.Runtime`
* Calculation-based sort terms are applied in Elixir after records are loaded

## [v0.4.1](https://github.com/diffo-dev/ash_neo4j/compare/v0.4.0...v0.4.1) (2026-05-06)

### What's Changed
* fix in_transaction? by @matt-beanland in https://github.com/diffo-dev/ash_neo4j/pull/226
* fixed sandbox and non-sandbox paths by @matt-beanland in https://github.com/diffo-dev/ash_neo4j/pull/227
* fix unhandled throws by @matt-beanland in https://github.com/diffo-dev/ash_neo4j/pull/228

## [v0.4.0](https://github.com/diffo-dev/ash_neo4j/compare/v0.3.1...v0.4.0) (2026-05-01)

### Features:
* real Neo4j transactions via `Bolty.transaction` — `can?(_, :transact)` now advertised, rollback genuinely aborts the database transaction
* `AshNeo4j.Sandbox` — test isolation adapter analogous to `Ecto.Adapters.SQL.Sandbox`, enabling safe parallel test execution with `async: true`

### Improvements:
* silenced spurious runtime `Logger.warning` calls that fired on normal OPTIONAL MATCH traversal
* full test suite parallelised with `async: true`

## [v0.3.1](https://github.com/diffo-dev/ash_neo4j/compare/v0.3.0...v0.3.1) (2026-04-23)

This release changes the storage type for Ash.Type.DateTime, Ash.Type.UtcDateTime and Ash.Type.UtcDateTimeUsec

### What's Changed
* use native neo4j 5.x datetime by @matt-beanland

## [v0.3.0](https://github.com/diffo-dev/ash_neo4j/compare/v0.2.15...v0.3.0) (2026-04-18)

This release changes the storage type for most types. Ash.Type dump_to_native/cast_stored are used where possible.T
String.Chars is no longer required and JSON blobs/Base64 are employed. Native Neo4j types are used except for datetime, instead we use ISO8601 strings to work around Neo4j 5.x incompatibility. There is no data migration supported.
