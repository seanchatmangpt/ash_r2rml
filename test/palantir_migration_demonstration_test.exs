defmodule AshR2RML.PalantirMigrationDemonstrationTest do
  @moduledoc """
  Scoped, mechanically-checked demonstration of the doctrine described in
  documentation/topics/palantir_kudzu_migration.md: a single incumbent
  ontology object migrating into a real Ash resource whose semantic
  relationships survive as a *generated* R2RML/Turtle projection, not a
  hand-duplicated copy.

  This does not exercise the full Kudzu phase list (Observe/Align/Admit/
  Manufacture/Verify/Move/Delete) or any real Palantir system. It proves
  exactly one falsifiable claim, matching this doc's own "Standing and
  falsifiers" section: that after admission and generation, "a generated
  projection must be reverse-engineered to reconstruct meaning" does NOT
  hold for this one object -- the class, both datatype properties, and the
  one link the incumbent object declares are all mechanically recoverable
  from the real, compiler-generated Turtle.
