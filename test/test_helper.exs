# Start the Bolt6 pool (Neo4j 2026.05 / Bolt 6.0) from the long-lived test_helper
# process so it survives the whole run. Bolty.start_link/1 links the pool to the
# calling process, so starting it from a per-test `setup` would tie its lifetime
# to a single test. Harmless when the pool is absent — `:bolt6` tests are
# excluded by default.

# Start the BoltApoc pool (Neo4j 5.x Community + APOC) for the :apoc round-trip

# `:cypher25` — needs a Neo4j ≥ 2025.06 server (the Bolt6 pool / 2026.05).
# `:bolt6` — reserved for tests that genuinely require the Bolt 6.0 protocol.
# `:apoc` — needs the BoltApoc pool (Neo4j + APOC).

# Cap test concurrency to the Bolt pool (#304). Each async test holds one sandbox
# connection (an open transaction) for its whole duration, so concurrency must
# not exceed the pool — otherwise tests contend for connections and fail in a
# cluster with DBConnection `:queue_timeout`. ExUnit's default `max_cases` is
# 2× schedulers, which exceeds the pool on many-core machines; tie it to the Bolt
# `pool_size` instead (the overflow connections absorb transient, cached
# `connection_info` checkouts).
