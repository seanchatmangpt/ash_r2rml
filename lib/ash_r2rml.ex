  Semantic mapping compiler between Ash resources and W3C R2RML.

  AshR2RML is not an Ash data layer and never owns persistence. Ash-first and
  ontology-first inputs converge on `AshR2RML.Mapping.Bundle`; R2RML is then a
  deterministic projection of that normalized IR. RDF serialization and SPARQL
  execution remain explicit boundary choices rather than alternate sources of
  truth.
