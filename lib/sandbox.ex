defmodule AshNeo4j.Sandbox do
  @moduledoc """
  Test sandbox for AshNeo4j, analogous to `Ecto.Adapters.SQL.Sandbox`.

  Each test that calls `checkout/0` gets a dedicated Neo4j connection with an
  open transaction. Every Cypher query executed by that test process runs
  inside that transaction. When the test process exits the transaction is
  rolled back automatically, so no data persists between tests and safe
  parallel execution (`async: true`) is possible.

  ## Usage

  Replace the `Neo4jHelper.delete_all()` pattern with a sandbox checkout:

      setup do
        AshNeo4j.Sandbox.checkout()
        on_exit(&AshNeo4j.Sandbox.rollback/0)
      end

  The `on_exit` call is optional. ExUnit's on_exit callbacks run in a separate
  process after the test process has already exited, so by the time
  `rollback/0` is called the transaction has already been rolled back via the
  holder's exit-signal trap. Including `on_exit(&AshNeo4j.Sandbox.rollback/0)`
  is harmless (it becomes a no-op) and is recommended for clarity.

  ## How it works

  `checkout/0` spawns a *holder* process linked to the test process. The holder
  opens a `Bolty.transaction/3` and waits for query messages. All
  `Cypher.run/2` calls from the test process are forwarded to the holder and
  executed on the single sandboxed connection, keeping every write inside the
  uncommitted transaction.

  When the test process exits (pass, fail, or crash) the link delivers an exit
  signal to the holder. Because the holder traps exits, the signal becomes a
  message that triggers `Bolty.rollback/2`, cleanly rolling back the
  transaction and returning the connection to the pool.

  ## Parallel tests

  Because each test's writes are confined to an isolated transaction that is
  never committed, concurrent tests cannot interfere with each other:

      use ExUnit.Case, async: true

      setup do
        AshNeo4j.Sandbox.checkout()
        on_exit(&AshNeo4j.Sandbox.rollback/0)
      end
  """

  @pdict_key :ash_neo4j_sandbox

  # The holder transaction stays checked out for the *whole* test, so it must
  # not inherit DBConnection's 15s default checkout timeout — a test whose
  # wall-clock exceeds that would otherwise be force-disconnected mid-run
  # (#398). Default to :infinity; ExUnit's own per-test timeout still bounds a
  # genuinely stuck test (its exit signals the holder to roll back).
  @default_holder_timeout :infinity

  @doc """
  Checks out a sandbox connection and begins a Neo4j transaction.

  All Cypher queries from the calling process are routed to this connection and
  executed within the open transaction. The transaction is rolled back
  automatically when the calling process exits.

  ## Options

    * `:timeout` — the DBConnection checkout timeout for the holder transaction,
      in milliseconds or `:infinity`. The holder is held for the entire test, so
      this must not be DBConnection's 15s default. Defaults to the application
      env `config :ash_neo4j, #{inspect(__MODULE__)}, timeout: …`, or
      `#{inspect(@default_holder_timeout)}` if unset.

  Raises if called more than once without an intervening `rollback/0`.

  Rolls back the sandbox transaction for the current process.

  When called from the same process as `checkout/0` this signals the holder to
